SpecialOverlay
==============

The Special Overlay tool allows you to aggregate data from one polygon layer to another, even when the boundaries do not match. This is done by determining the percentage of a given polygon from the input features that falls within a given polygon in the overlay features (study area), then assigning that percentage of the value from the input polygon to the overlay polygon.

This script was developed for a GIS Programming course at the University of Minnesota by Agata Miszczyk and Taylor Long.
